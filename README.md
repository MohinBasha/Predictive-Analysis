# Predictive-Analysis
📘 Predictive Analytics & Machine Learning – CA Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook–based project developed as part of INT-234 Continuous Assessment (CA-2). The project focuses on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model implementation using Python.

🔹 Project Overview

The notebook demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of a predictive analytics task, starting from data loading and cleaning to model building and evaluation. Multiple machine learning algorithms are implemented and compared to understand their performance and behavior on the given dataset.

🔹 Key Components
